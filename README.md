# NeuralNetworks

Welcome to my collection of Neural Network projects!
I hope to make this repository helpful for those beginning their ML/AI/Data Science journey (as I am, upon writing this in Aug. 2020).

- MNISTviaCNN 
This is a project that I hope to continue working on in the future (when I learn a lot more with respect to CNN), possibly implementing Keras (though it and Tensorflow have been unnecessarily difficult, so PyTorch all the way!); a Kaggle submission for this repository can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/halljc/cnn-with-mnist-dataset
